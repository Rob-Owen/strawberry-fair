DESCRIPTION:Now in our second year\, The Flying Pig Stage is dedicated to b
	ringing you a great day of live music\; a handpicked choice of some of the
	 best musicians and bands we have been lucky enough to find. A mixture of 
	styles including - but certainly not limited to - Cajun\, Americana\, Funk
	\, Blues\, Rock and Roll\, Folk\, Jazz and Country Art Rock. Some local\, 
	including the winners of Best Acoustic Act at this year's Cambridge Band C
	ompetition\, some from further afield\; this year we have bands from Rome 
	and NYC added so we feel we are truly going international! One thing that 
	ties these wonderful acts together (apart from musical greatness!) is that
	 each has at some point graced the Flying Pig pub with their presence and 
	left a wonderful and lasting memory. We feel live music has been an import
	ant part of Strawberry Fair ever since we started attending it as teenager
	s and are thrilled to play a part in such a fantastic event. All we need n
	ow is you! Lots of love from all of us at The Flying Pig Stage
