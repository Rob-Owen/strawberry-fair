  - _markdown_contentBody: "From humble beginnings, Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular free, entirely volunteer run, one day music & arts event in Cambridge (and probably across Europe!), attracting over 30,000 visitors throughout the day. On the first Saturday of June and now passed our 40th year, residents and visitors have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their vibrant and creative city.\r\n\nThe Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out."

    title: Welcome to Strawberry Fair
  - _markdown_contentBody: "Strawberry Fair is a not-for-profit organisation run entirely by a team of volunteers (The Fairies!) who work throughout the year (yes it really does take that long to organise!) sorting out everything to do with the Fair; from finding artists and organising stages, to managing traders and fundraising, right through to working out how many toilets are needed....!!\r\n\nStrawberry Fair couldn't happen without all of the people who, generously, volunteer their time and effort throughout the to make our unique event happen."
