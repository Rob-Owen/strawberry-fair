Thanks for taking the time to apply to perform at Strawberry Fair.  We will make sure we consider every submission we get, but considering the large number of acts that apply, we will not be able to get back to everyone and apologise if you do not hear from us.

Please bear in mind that this is a free entry event and we do not pay fees to musical acts.

This year, we are particularly looking for visual arts and theatre performers to run alongside music and poetry.  Immersive theatre, walkabout performers?  Please get in touch!
