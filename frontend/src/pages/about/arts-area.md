Eastern Bloco emerged out of the old arts area in 2013. We wanted to keep a section of the Fair specifically for visual and performance artists. Here visitors join in the creativity started by Rebel Arts and curated by alternative artists. Five years later some of the artists have moved into their tents, making art that is amazing, inspiring, and always challenging. Free Tale and Free Shop offer an alternative shopping experience, Wild Strawberries poets and wordsmiths are slamming and jamming on their festival stage, the Geodesic Dome is a creative space where anything can happen and……the rest is up to you.

Eastern Bloco is a loose affiliation of artistic activists and creatives highlighting and raising awareness of political issues surrounding us through a wide range of mediums. We invite you to celebrate ordinary and spectacular people with us, join us for a rhapsodic, magniloquent, purple, political experience with plenty of unexpected moments.
