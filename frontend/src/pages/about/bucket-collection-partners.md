We are proud to collaborate with some outstanding local charities in our fundraising efforts. You will see some great volunteers all around the fair, so please donate any change you have. Remember, we are completely funded by the community, no corporate sponsors!

The charities we are collaborating with this year are:

# Cambridge Museum of Technology

Cambridge Museum of Technology enables people to explore, enjoy and learn about our local industrial heritage. The Museum, based in the city’s Victorian Pumping Station next to the River Cam, is currently undergoing a major redevelopment, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, which will be completed in 2019. This will create a vibrant new asset for local people and visitors to Cambridge to enjoy.

The Engineer in charge of the Pumping Station lived in a handsome house next to the site.  The house, which had been sadly neglected for some years, has now come into the possession of the Museum.  We want to restore the building to its former glory, reclaim the garden and develop it as an exciting new space for the local community.   The costs for this are not covered by the redevelopment project so we are seeking help for this unique initiative.

To find out more about the Engineer’s House, the Museum, and how you can support our work, please visit [www.museumoftechnology.com

Cambridge Museum of Technology is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation registered in England with charity No. 1156685

# Cambridgeshire Hearing Help

Cambridgeshire Hearing Help supports people with hearing loss to maintain their wellbeing and independence. Its services include the provision of community-based NHS hearing aid maintenance for 6,000 people per year who face barriers to accessing mainstream audiology services for routine hearing aid maintenance because they are older, frail, have other disabilities, or live in rural areas. Other services include: hearing loss information/advice/signposting, awareness-raising talks to community groups, hearing-aid maintenance training for residential homes and care agencies, lip-reading classes in Cambridge, Living Well with Hearing Loss workshops for people with a newly acquired hearing loss, peer support, and rewarding volunteering roles.
